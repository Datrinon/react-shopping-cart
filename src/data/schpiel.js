Mako Bikes started in a small Californian garage in 1970, but our founders always saw something bigger. Fifty years later, we're on a mission to make the world a healthier, happier place through the power of bicycles.

With the arrival of electric bikes, we at Mako understood that the joyous experience of biking was reborn.We thus set out to change to world by providing the best experience possible in terms of hospitality, customer service, and e-bikes.

For us, it's not just about the bike, it's about getting you where you were meant to be.
