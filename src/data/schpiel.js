Mako Bikes started in a small Californian garage in 1970, but our founders always saw something bigger. Fifty years later, we're on a mission to make the world a healthier, happier place through the power of bicycles.

With the arrival of electric bikes, we at Mako understood that the joyous experience of biking was reborn, and thus set out to provide incredible hospitality to our customers, and change the world by getting more people on bikes.

Despite the countless years we've provided outstanding customer service and bicycles, for us, it's never just about those things for us.

It's about getting you closer to the places you were meant to be.
